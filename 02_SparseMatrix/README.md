# TODO:
- test the compressions (both)
- test setter/getter method
- move the col and row operations to different files
- implement the matrix-vector multiplication

- documentation
- time stopping


# Design Decisions
- no bound checks for the getter methods, to achieve maximal performance

# Learning
- class members can only be template specialized, if the class itself is already specialized
